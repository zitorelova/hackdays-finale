# AWS Hackdays Finale

This repository contains some of the training scripts I used for the self-driving car competition at the [AWS Hackdays Finale](https://aws.amazon.com/events/startup-day-jakarta/) in Jakarta, Indonesia.
My team won [2nd place](https://businessmirror.com.ph/2018/11/04/phl-team-places-2nd-in-aws-hackdays-2018-grand-finale/) overall.
